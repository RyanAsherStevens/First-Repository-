# The-Copper-Onion
The Copper Onion is website that I made for my dad, Kevin Shawn Stevens.

Blog Section:
-The blog section contains a dropdown menu that you can click and go to any part on the page to.
-The Welcome section (has lorem ipsum text) introduces the website.
-Its followed by pictures of things that my dad has worked on at his work.
-Then the blog section that he will update regularly talking about tours at distilleries, also he will talk about different types of bourbon and different events.
-Then the history section which will talk about the history of certain distilleries and the history behind bourbon in kentucky.
-Work section talks about work at Vendome Copper and Brass and some of things that he has worked on there.
-The about section talks about himself and how certain things influence him at certain distilleries.
-Social media links are in the footer and all work but need to be signed into facebook to see.

Things to make it run:
-make sure JavaScript is enabled.
-the main components are, the html, main.css, and main.js.
-also need the pictures to download that way the carousel works properly.
