# The-Copper-Onion
A website I created for my dad Kevin Shawn Stevens.

Main section:
-Displays a dropdown menu that works on all screen sizes. Each section in the dropdown menu is clickable and will take you to that section on the page.
-The welcome section is made of a whiskey Lorem Ipsum.
-Also has a working carousel that displays different pictures of things my dad has worked on relating to bourbon in some fashion.
-Then the blog section
-The rest of the sections, include history of distilleries in the state and his experiences at those distilleries. Then the work section in which he talks about some of the hardware that he has worked on that ended up at certain distilleries and his time at Vendome Copper and Brass. And then finally an about section in which he talks about himself personally. 

Needed to run the page: 
-The html has all of the links to the cdn's in which i used to get the carousel running.
-The CSS file has all of the different styles i used along with the different media queries as well.
-The JavaScript has the custom carousel functions and dropdown menu functions that I used.
-JavaScript must be turned on.
-The social media links work and must be logged in to access them.
-Make sure you download the my_first_repository to access all of the up to date code in one folder.
-Download all of the pictures in the img folder for them to pull up.
